## Introduction

My name is Jonathan Revanaldi Alexandro Christian, but most people know me as Nathan. At 17 years old, I'm currently studying at SMK Karya Andalas Palembang in the accounting specialization, but my passion lies in game development and automation tools. This is the story of how I created Astralune MMORPG, a game that represents my journey as a young developer.

## Early Interest in Programming

My interest in programming began when I was 14 years old. I started with simple scripts and gradually moved to more complex applications. My curiosity about how games work led me to explore game development, and eventually, I decided to create my own MMORPG.

## Creating Astralune MMORPG

Developing Astralune MMORPG was a challenging but rewarding experience. I used Rust with the Rocket framework for the backend, and for the game client, I leveraged my knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript. The game features a persistent world where players can explore, battle, and interact with each other in real-time.

One of the biggest challenges was creating a scalable server architecture that could handle multiple players simultaneously. I spent countless hours optimizing the code and implementing efficient algorithms to ensure smooth gameplay.

## Developing the Astralune MMORPG WhatsApp Bot

To complement the game, I also created a WhatsApp bot that allows players to interact with the game world even when they're not playing. The bot provides updates, allows players to check their stats, and even enables some in-game actions. I used Golang with the Gin framework to build the bot's backend, taking advantage of its efficiency and performance.

## Learning and Growth

Throughout this journey, I've learned numerous technologies and frameworks. My favorite tools include:

- **Rust**: With frameworks like Rocket and Leptos, Rust has become my go-to language for performance-critical applications.
- **Golang**: For building efficient backend services, I rely on Gin and Echo frameworks.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: For frontend development and bot creation, I use Next.js, Vue, Vite, Fastify, and Astro.

Each project has taught me valuable lessons about software architecture, user experience, and the importance of clean, maintainable code.

## Future Plans

As I continue my studies at SMK Karya Andalas Palembang, I plan to further develop Astralune MMORPG and potentially create new games. My goal is to establish myself as a professional game developer and contribute to the growing gaming industry.

I'm constantly learning new technologies and exploring innovative ways to enhance the gaming experience. The journey has just begun, and I'm excited about what the future holds.

## Conclusion

Being a young developer has its challenges, but it's incredibly rewarding to see your creations come to life. Creating Astralune MMORPG has been a dream come true, and I hope to inspire other young developers to pursue their passions regardless of their age or circumstances.
